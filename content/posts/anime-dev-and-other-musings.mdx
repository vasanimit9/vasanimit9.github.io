This article is actually a story from my life. I am a web dev enthusiast and an anime enthusiast. The two of these things have had more of my time in the last four to five years than everything else combined. So I decided to write about how these things have affected my life the way they have.

The first time I consciously dabbled into anime was when I binged Naruto + Naruto Shippuuden in 4.5 weeks, with about 700 episodes, in late 2017. I could relate to the eponymous character a lot because I was at a low point in my life. Naruto was an orphan who was detested and ignored and avoided for most of his childhood and early teens. He was excluded everywhere. What makes the story special is that his sorrows and pain only made him more kind and considerate and empathizing. They also made him work really hard to find a place where he belonged. His kindness and empathy allowed him to forge bonds with a large number of people. The anime helped me realize that most of us are just trying to find our own place, a place where we belong, and you never realize when the littlest of things might make someone feel better, might help them come back from just being on the verge of giving up. Mental health issues are a lot more common than any of us realize.

The anime has some really beautiful and quotable dialogue. The one that has stuck in my head, and has helped me through some really tough situations is:

> "A place where someone still thinks about you is a place you can call home."

One more quote that has stuck with me, and is actually helpful in coping with anxiety, is:

> "When people are protecting something truly precious to them. They truly can become… as strong as they need to be!"

The main character deals with a lot of trauma, and the story is about him trying to overcome the trauma and achieve his dreams, and so the anime might pull more strings for some people than it would for others. It is not an anime, it is a way of life. This anime is the epitome of "If you want to make people feel included, you must first know what it feels like to be lonely."

Another anime that holds a big place in my heart, coincidentally, is also about an orphan. The name is *March Comes In Like A Lion*. The anime revolves around a teenage boy (Rei Kiriyama), who's also just the fifth person to become a professional shogi player in middle school, and a family of three sisters (the Kawamoto sisters), who are both dealing with loss and grief. The story of this anime is the most beautiful story I have experienced. It captures the multitudes of sides each person has really amazingly. It also shows how families (not just the biological ones) help people in navigating through life without actively trying to do that a lot of times.

> "Even after a long long time, something can save you, coming in like a storm from an entirely unexpected direction."

Everyone feels lost at some point in their lives, lost and aimless. Everyone has bad days. Everyone goes through a lot of things. And sometimes, all their lives are just recovering from what they went through. Sometimes people don't find ways to recover from their wounds and scars for a long long time. And then suddenly, surprisingly, something happens that helps them realize how they can heal from all the hurt and pain they carry, and then life becomes beautiful and bright again.

Although the most inspiring anime that I have come across is *Haikyuu*. It is a sports anime about volleyball. It has very accurate descriptions and animations of the movements of players and the rules of the sport. But more importantly, it has great character development. It is a story about hard work, determination, and perseverance. It is a story of contrasting developments as individual people. The story tells you that some things in life are always achieved as a team, and the better team is the one that does good work collectively than the one which is a group of individuals who do good work.

> "Talent is something you make bloom. Instinct is something you polish."

These are the three anime that have impacted me the most as a person. But in around December 2019, I felt a strong urge to share the thing that has helped me go through some really tough times and made me a better person — anime — in a way that would encourage more people to try out the medium. So I turned to the only tool for this in my arsenal: web dev.

I decided to create a feed of quotes and news from the anime world. I built a simple CRUD application in Flask using tinydb, used BeautifulSoup to scrape various anime news outlets, and wrote the front-end in plain HTML, CSS, and JS with the Materialize CSS framework. This was the first time I made a web app for something I was passionate about.

The first feature I added was making it a progressive web app. Just a basic installable web app with a custom offline page. Then I made it into a single-page application, learned about different caching strategies, and implemented them.

In the quest to make it a better web app, I also learned React, and implemented the whole app with a totally different UI. I integrated various APIs for other information related to anime.

To take things one step further, I started looking into cross-platform app development and learned Flutter. Then I got interested in Ionic and React Native. I built an app for the website in Flutter but decided I'd have more fun with React Native, so I built an app with that as well.

While the PWA or the app aren't live or available on the play store or the app store, I ended up learning about all these new technologies in the span of 3 months since starting with React in October 2020. Anime still continues to inspire me, and I am still a web/app dev enthusiast, so after all this time I thought I should start expressing my love for anime and dev using words instead. So here we are. I'll keep posting about anime, dev, and other musings here.
