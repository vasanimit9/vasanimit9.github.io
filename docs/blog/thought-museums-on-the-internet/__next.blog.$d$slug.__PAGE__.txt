Like Joel, Paul also has a lot of opinions. His essays are usually about programming, programmers, startups and how those affect the world around us. They have been highly thought provoking for me for two reasons. One, some of the topics that he has explored in his essays have resonated with me. Two, some essays have given me other perspectives on things I have been curious about."}]
