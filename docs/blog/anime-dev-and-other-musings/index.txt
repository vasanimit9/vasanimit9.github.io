He was excluded everywhere. What makes the story special is that his sorrows and pain only made him more kind and considerate and empathizing. They also made him work really hard to find a place where he belonged. His kindness and empathy allowed him to forge bonds with a large number of people. The anime helped me realize that most of us are just trying to find our own place, a place where we belong, and you never realize when the littlest of things might make someone feel better, might help them come back from just being on the verge of giving up.
