A realization hits him that he is average, unlike other people on the team, who are among the best in one or the other thing.

But whenever I have come across these words, they have helped me stop doing that and do whatever I needed to do to move forward. To have the guts to tell yourself to get up when you are hurt and don't feel like doing anything is no mean feat. Remember never to pity yourself."}]
